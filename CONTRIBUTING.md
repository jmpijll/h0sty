### Architecture Guidelines

#### MVVM Pattern
- **Models**: Data structures and business logic
- **Views**: SwiftUI views and UI components
- **ViewModels**: Mediate between Models and Views

#### Security Considerations
- All system file modifications must go through the privileged helper tool
- Validate all user input
- Handle errors gracefully
- Never store sensitive information

#### UI/UX Guidelines
- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- Support both light and dark modes
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Use native SwiftUI components
- Maintain consistency with macOS design patterns

### Testing

#### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
xcodebuild test -project H0sty.xcodeproj -scheme H0sty

# Or use Xcode: Product â†’ Test (âŒ˜+U)
```

#### Integration Tests
- Test the full workflow from UI to system file modification
- Verify helper tool communication
- Test error handling paths

#### Manual Testing
- Test on different macOS versions
- Verify both light and dark mode appearance
- Test with various hosts file configurations
- Validate admin permission workflows

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update REQUIREMENTS.md for technical changes
- Add inline code documentation
- Update CHANGELOG.md following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format

### Release Process
